         <p>New Hope Bourbon Stop is a vacation rental located in the heart of Bourbon Country. This one-of-a-kind building has been in our family for three generations.</p>

         <p>In the late 1930s our grandparents bought the building and started the New Hope Grocery Store. Later they added the Dance Hall. In those years it was “the place to be”, and for many years both the store and dance hall thrived. As our grandparents aged, they closed the store and focused on their farmland.</p>

         <p>The year 2014 was a turning point for the old “Old Grocery Store” as it’s called by the locals. That was the year my brother and I inherited the building. We felt passionate about the legacy of our family place and didn’t want to just let it go.</p>

         <p>Realizing that New Hope sits in the heart of Bourbon Country and is centrally located to many attractions and sights, we decided to undergo a total renovation. Now we would love to share our family home with YOU! Nelson County is filled with beautiful farmland and landscape. The drive and the sunsets alone are sights to behold.</p>
